// Requirements : Complete all previous steps, then :
// • Allow the user to set a daily calories goal when program begins, and display their progress as a percentage after each entry.
// • Add an intensity level selection(Low, Medium, High) that affects the calories burn
// rate. For example:
// - Low: 0.03 calories per step
// - Medium: 0.04 calories per step
// - High: 0.06 calories per step
// Give user this choice each time they try entering the number of steps or distance.
// • Implement robust input validation for all user inputs, including:
// - Ensuring numeric values are positive integers
// - Handling invalid menu choices gracefully
// - Re-prompting the user until valid input is received
// • Within your portfolio, explain how the input validation works and which (if any) inputs
// are still causing program to not function correctly – and why this was not addressed.
